# Boomtown üèô

- Boomtown is an online application that allows user share items.
  A user may post what he/she would like to share and other users can
  select what they need from a pool of available items and borrow it for a period of time.

- An application consists of two main components: server and client.

  - Server component provides basis for the application functionality and access to the database

  - Client component helps users interact with the application: create accounts, add items
    to the pool, search and borrow avialable items.
